Thresher DCC
-----------------

1. Introduction

Thresher supports the four most popular DCC commands: Chat, Send, Accept, and Resume. It also
supports one of the extension protocols: Get. Thresher is fully compatible with all the major IRC
clients for Windows, Mac, and Unix. 

Some newer clients can use the 'send-ahead' or turbo mode for file exchanges. This mode is much
faster then legacy mode transfers but is not supported by all clients, for example neither mIRC nor Ircle 
support it. Thresher supports both legacy and turbo mode file transfers.


2. Compatibility

Thresher was tested against the following clients:
  
Client		Platform	Notes
------		---------	----------------------------------------------------------
mirc		Windows		No turbo mode or get support. Uses small file receive buffer.
bersirc		Windows		Supports turbo mode but not get. Unstable on file receives.
virc		Windows		Supports turbo mode but not get. 
bitchx		Unix		No turbo mode or get support. Has own turbo mode which Thresher understands.
ircle		Mac		No turbo mode or get support. Solid DCC implementation.
