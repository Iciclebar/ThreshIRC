<BODY>
<P>This document is an overview of all the parameters used in the 005 numeric 
(RPL_ISUPPORT) of the IRC protocol, with a short description of what all the 
parameters mean. 
<P>For a more formal defenition of this numeric see <A 
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-01.txt">Edward 
Brocklesby's ISUPPORT draft.</A> 
<P>This page now just lists some examples of what is being used, which include 
things not in the draft. The reason they're not in draft is because they are 
either experimental or considered to be of no real use. 
<P>A simple example output: 
<P><SAMP>:irc.example.org 005 nick PREFIX=(ov)@+ CHANTYPES=#&amp; :are supported 
by this server </SAMP>
<P>Here is the list with all parameters with a short description:

They don't seem to put any documentation online. 
<P>TOPICLEN, KICKLEN and CHANNELLEN are considered to be useless and may be

<P>Some older version of this document said CHARMAPPING instead of CASEMAPPING. 
This was an error and has been corrected.
