1.0beta3 - 30 June 2002
-----------------------------------
* Cleaned up the connect/disconnect code in Connection. There are 3 ways
   the connection can close:
   1. By User Request -> connection.Disconnect() 
       - Events raised: OnDisconnecting() then OnDisconnected()
   2. IRC Server closes connection (it goes down or you were bad and got kicked)
       - Events raised: OnError() with code -1 then OnDisconnected()
   3. Network connection fails ( your modem hangs up, someone kicks the cable, etc..)
		- Events raised: OnError() with code -1 then OnDisconnected()
* Added a PrivateAction event/command
* Added the ability to send arbitrary messages to the IRC server via Sender.Raw()

   library. API's for encrypted connections to the IRC server, DCC Chat, and DCC file transfers.
* Changed text stream encoding from UTF to Default due to a possible bug.
  (Thanks to Llewellyn for pointing this one out).
* Added 2 events to Connection (OnRawMessageReceived,OnRawMessageSent)
  that allow developers to see the raw messages as they are sent and received.
* Thresher can be easily extended with the new custom parser API.

  * DccChatSession objects now use the text encoding property of the Connection object passed to 
     it as part of the DccUserInfo. (Did you get all that?)
